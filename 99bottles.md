This shows off raft movement, jumps, and the cannon. I could have written it with just a simple loop, but this way was much more fun.

The program starts with the cannon's raft moving north. The cannon destroys the west-most + on the top row and then moves back again. After a couple jumps, the raft of +s start moving up (if possible), thus moving a new line into position if the last had all been destroyed by the cannon. A couple more jumps and the raft of .s starts moving toward the raft of +s. The .s are to slow program execution before the raft reaches its position. As the program flow leaves that raft to board the raft of +s, the current memory position is reset to 0 and the raft sent moving back to its former position. Program flow runs along the lines of the raft, incrementing the current memory position by one each time. Since another + gets destroyed each time through, we ultimately end up counting down from 99. After that raft, the program jumps the printing out " bottles of beer on the wall" before jumping back to the cannon raft and the process repeats.
